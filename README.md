# Introduction 

_VessMorphoVis_ is an integrated suite of toolboxes for interactive visualization and analysis of 
vast brain vascular networks represented by morphological graphs segmented originally from imaging 
or microscopy stacks. Our workflow leverages the outstanding potentials of Blender, aiming to 
establish an integrated, extensible and domain-specific framework capable of interactive 
visualization, analysis, repair, high-fidelity meshing and high-quality rendering of vascular 
morphologies.

## Features

+ Interactive visualization, analysis and automated repair of large-scale vasculature morphology 
skeletons (up to millions of samples).

+ Sketching and building three-dimensional representations of the vascular morphology skeletons 
using various methods for visual analytics.

+ Analysis of neuronal morphology skeletons that are digitally reconstructed from imaging or 
microscopy stacks. 

+ An easy context to load broken morphology skeletons and repair them manually. 

+ Automated reconstruction of polygonal mesh models that represent the surface of the vasvular 
morphologies based on the piecewise meshing method presented by 
[Abdellah et al., 2017](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-017-1788-4).

+ Accurate mesh reconstruction with MetaBalls to create watertight meshes for 
[reaction-diffusion simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system).

+ Large scale and efficient rendering of the vascular morphologies and meshes using the 
Workbench renderer.
 
+ Automated high quality rendering of the vascular morphologies and their corresponding meshes 
using different shading nodes with Cycles.

+ Exporting the reconstructed meshes in several file formats including 
[PLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)), 
[OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file), 
[STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) 
and also as a Blender file ([.blend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)#File_format)).

# Package Details

_VessMorphoVis_ is mainly based on [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). 
Blender is a free software and can be downloaded from [Blender.org](http://download.blender.org/release/). 
Blender is released under the GNU General Public License ([GPL](https://www.blender.org/about/license/), or 
“free software”).
The current version of _VessMorphoVis_ is compatible with the following Blender versions:

+ [Blender 2.80](http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.80/)
+ [Blender 2.81](http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.81/)
+ [Blender 2.82](http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.82/)
+ [Blender 2.83](http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.83/)

_VessMorphoVis_ can be downloaded as a __binary archive bundled within Blender__ that can be easily 
extracted and used [out-of-the-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_box_(feature)). 
The optional dependencies are already shiped within this archive using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) 
on each respective platform. This package (released every minor version update of the software) is 
recommended for __Windows users__ or those who cannot use 
the [__Terminal__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell). 
Otherwise, users can just download an installation script that will automatically install the entire 
package to a user-specified directory. This script __does not__ require __sudo__ permissions.

and Posterior Cerebral Arteries (PCAs).
