# Introduction 

VessMorphoVis is an integrated suite of toolboxes for interactive visualization and analysis of vast brain vascular networks represented by morphological graphs segmented originally from imaging or microscopy stacks. Our workflow leverages the outstanding potentials of Blender, aiming to establish an integrated, extensible and domain-specific framework capable of interactive visualization, analysis, repair, high-fidelity meshing and high-quality rendering of vascular morphologies.

## Features

+ Interactive visualization, analysis and automated repair of large-scale vasculature morphology skeletons.
+ Sketching and building three-dimensional representations of the vascular morphology skeletons using various methods for visual analytics.
+ Automated analysis of neuronal morphology skeletons that are digitally reconstructed from optical microscopy stacks. 
+ An easy context to load broken morphology skeletons and repair them manually. 
+ Automated reconstruction of polygonal mesh models that represent the surface of the vasvular morphologies based on the piecewise meshing method presented by [Abdellah et al., 2017](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-017-1788-4).
+ Accurate mesh reconstruction with meta balls to create watertight meshes for reaction-diffusion simulations.
+ Exporting the reconstructed meshes in several file formats including [PLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)), [OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file), [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) and also as a Blender file ([.blend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)#File_format)).
